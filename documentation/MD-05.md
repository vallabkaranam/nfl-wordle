# MD-05 — End-to-End Fullstack Verification (Pre-Deploy)

## Purpose
Perform a final end-to-end verification of the application using real data
to ensure it is production-ready.

This is a verification pass, not a feature pass.

## In Scope
- Run backend and frontend together locally
- Use real nflreadpy-backed roster data (from cache)
- Exercise all user flows:
  - App load
  - Daily player selection
  - Player search
  - Guess submission
  - Higher / lower hints
  - Win state
  - Loss state
- Verify frontend-backend communication
- Check for console errors
- Validate UX sanity (clarity, feedback, button behavior)

## Out of Scope
- No new features
- No gameplay changes
- No visual redesign
- No refactors unless required to fix a failing flow
- No performance tuning unless something is broken

## Fix Policy
Only fix:
- Crashes
- Broken API calls
- Incorrect data
- Misleading or incorrect UI states

If everything works correctly:
- Make no changes

## Success Criteria
- Application works end-to-end with real data
- No functional bugs remain
- App is ready for deployment
