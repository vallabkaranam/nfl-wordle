# MD-06 — UI Polish & Documentation Finalization

## Purpose
Apply final UI polish and produce comprehensive documentation so the project
is understandable, runnable, and deployable by any developer.

This is the final step before project closure.

## In Scope

### UI Polish
- Fix visual issue where the "down" icon (dropdown/chevron) is clipped or cut off
- Ensure the icon is fully visible across common screen sizes
- Allowed changes:
  - CSS spacing
  - line-height
  - overflow
  - padding/margin
- No layout or component redesign

### Documentation
Create or expand documentation to include:

#### README.md (root)
- Project overview (what this app is)
- How the game works (brief)
- Tech stack (frontend, backend, data)
- Repo structure overview
- Local development (frontend + backend)
- Environment variables
- Deployment overview (Render)

#### Deployment Docs
- Confirm Render as the deployment target
- Explain:
  - Frontend service
  - Backend service
  - Required env vars
  - Build & start commands
- Mention cold-start behavior on free tier

## Out of Scope
- No new features
- No gameplay changes
- No refactors
- No dependency changes
- No performance work

## Success Criteria
- UI icon is no longer clipped
- README is clear, complete, and professional
- A new developer can:
  - run the app locally
  - understand the architecture
  - deploy it to Render
- No functional behavior changes
