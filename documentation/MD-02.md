# MD-02 — Backend Data Load Stabilization

## Purpose
Prevent slow or failing backend startups by stabilizing NFL roster data loading
for production environments.

## Problem
The backend currently fetches NFL roster data via nflreadpy on every server startup.
This causes:
- Slow cold starts (10–30s)
- Risk of timeouts on Render/Railway
- Unnecessary repeated network calls

## In Scope
- Load roster data once and cache it locally (JSON file)
- On startup:
  - If cached data exists, load from disk
  - If not, fetch via nflreadpy and write cache
- Preserve existing fallback behavior (2025 → 2024)
- No behavior change to API consumers

## Out of Scope
- No databases
- No background jobs
- No new endpoints
- No cron or build pipeline changes

## Requirements
- Cache file must live inside backend directory (e.g. `data/players.json`)
- Cache read/write must be explicit and safe
- Backend must still boot locally without setup steps
- Clear log output indicating cache hit vs fetch

## Success Criteria
- Backend startup is fast after first run
- No repeated nflreadpy fetches on every boot
- App behavior remains identical
