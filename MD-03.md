# MD-03 — Logic Consistency & Cleanup

## Purpose
Remove brittle logic and minor inconsistencies without changing behavior.

## In Scope
- Standardize guess result strings across game logic and UI
- Remove unused or dead logic paths if clearly obsolete
- Improve type safety where trivial

## Out of Scope
- No UX changes
- No gameplay changes
- No refactors
- No styling changes

## Requirements

### Game Logic
- `checkGuess` result values must be consistent with UI expectations
- No silent fallbacks due to mismatched string literals

### UI
- Components should not rely on accidental defaults
- Explicit handling > implicit behavior

## Success Criteria
- Game behavior is unchanged
- Logic is explicit and non-brittle
- No new code paths introduced
